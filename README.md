# Project goal

The goal of this project is to create a Next.js app that can use the OpenAI API to comment on a short piece of code given by the user. The app will have a form where the user can enter a piece of code, and when the form is submitted, the app will call the OpenAI API and display the commented code in the app.

# Technologies used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): a React-based framework for building server-rendered apps
- [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create): a suite of APIs for natural language processing and machine learning
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): a typed superset of JavaScript that scales
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
